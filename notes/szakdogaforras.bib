									abstract = "Model predictive control (MPC) is highly suitable for building heating and cooling control because it exploits disturbance predictions, obeys constraints, and enables optimal building operation in terms of user comfort and energy efficiency. This work presents a highly efficient nonlinear modular MPC concept. It optimally controls both, heating and cooling activities in a low-energy office building simultaneously. Relevant system nonlinearities are considered through a nonlinear prediction model, an LTI MPC optimization step, and an efficient mixed-integer mapping to setpoint temperatures in the building. The involved optimization problems are efficiently solvable and enable realtime control, and the controller structure allows for retrofitting and can directly be incorporated into the existing building control infrastructure. A clear formulation of thermal user comfort and energy efficiency allows straightforward tuning. Excellent control performance and robustness are observed in detailed co-simulation studies, significantly outperforming a classical rule-based reference control law. Possible approaches to analyze robust stability of the controlled system are discussed and related to results of robust TS-fuzzy system analysis."

									abstract = "This work presents a literature review of control methods, with an emphasis on the theory and applications of model predictive control (MPC) for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Several control methods used for HVAC control are identified from the literature review, and a brief survey of each method is presented. Next, the performance of MPC is compared with that of other control approaches. Factors affecting MPC performance (including control configuration, process type, model, optimization technique, prediction horizon, control horizon, constraints, and cost function) are elaborated using specific examples from the literature. The gaps in MPC research are identified, and future directions are highlighted."
