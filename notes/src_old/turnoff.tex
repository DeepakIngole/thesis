	\section{Turn off sequence}\label{iii.-turn-off-sequence}
	
	\begin{todolist}
	\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
	\item
	  Set the system to autopilot off / human pilot mode
	\item
	  Set the throttle stick to lowest position
	\item
	  Disconnect the power from the ESCs: open the circuit breaker at side
	  of nacelles
	\item
	  Place back the protective cap of the aeroprobe as soon as possible
	\item
	  Connect to the Raspberry Pi via WiFi or cable,
	
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
	  \item
	    Copy/transfer the logs from the RPI if needed - You can do this
	    later on
	  \end{itemize}
	\item
	  Turn off the Raspberry Pi:
	
	  \begin{itemize}
	  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
	  \item
	    Shut down the SW\_PI software with \textbf{Ctrl+C}
	  \item
	    Send a \texttt{sudo poweroff} command to the system, and wait for
	    10s
	  \end{itemize}
	\item
	  Remove the top casing from the main fuselage
	\item
	  Plug the BEC RBF jumpers to the back of the fuselage
	\item
	  Unplug the \textbf{6S} battery at the front of fuselage (flightHAT)
	\item
	  Unplug the \textbf{2S} batteries at the back of the fuselage (servo
	  batteries)
	\item
	  Unplug the remaining two \textbf{2S} batteries at the front of the
	  fuselage (RX-MUX units)
	\item
	  Turn off the JETI transmitter (take back into its casing if not used
	  further)
	\end{todolist}
	
	Now everything is unpowered.
	
	\subsubsection*{Battery replacement of nacelles after flight}\label{battery-replacement-after-flight}
	
	For battery replacement or A/C disassembly, do the following steps:
	
	\begin{todolist}
	\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
	\item
	  Remove the nacelle covers - put back the screws to their places
	\item
	  Disconnect the \textbf{6S} battery connectors from the ESCs inside
	  each nacelle
	\item
	  Remove all the discharged batteries and \textbf{separate the used}
	  from charged ones!
	\item
	  Remove all battery alarms from the batteries
	\end{todolist}
	
	If the A/C is about to be dissassembled, go to the next section. If not,
	then you should repeat from \emph{Battery check and placement} section.
